Where Condors Dare
==================

Introduction
------------

**Where Condors Dare** is an adventure for 4-6 beginning characters, 
designed to be completed within three to four hours. 
It's written for an experienced Keeper running a convention game for a few people
that could have no prior experience with the game.

Each of the six following sections is design to last for 30 to 40 minutes.
The structure of the adventure allows to split it into two sessions of less than two hours,
ending the first session after the escape plan is revealed (see **The Prison Beyond**).

The Mountain Crossing
---------------------

The Uncovered Tower
-------------------

#### 1. Tower Entrance

#### 2. Room 1

#### 3. Room 2 (with stairs going up)

#### 4. The Sorcerous Study

- bookshelves
- fancy stuff
- image on the wall
- shows treasure in a room, seems to be alive
- examining the image calls for a wisdom check, players will think it's perception, but it's a willpower test
- failure means the character can't resist touching the image
- touching the image sucks all living creatures in the room inside the image, to a space beyond space

The Prison Beyond
-----------------

River God's Favor
-----------------

    Looking into the portal reveals a dark forest, thick with gnarled trees. 
    There's a glimmer of blue running through the green, a rushing river 
    that stubbornly reflects the sky above the treetops.

As the characters examine the first portal, [INSERT WIZARD NAME HERE] speaks:

> If we want to escape, we need to shake the very foundations of this mountain. I need you to make an offering to the old gods.
> What you see beyond this portal is a good place for a sacrifice to the River God.
